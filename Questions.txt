Task 1: Enquiry and Transaction Counts

In the enquiry-txn dataset, create a table that stores the number of enquiries and the
number of transactions performed by each user on each date, without using JOIN.

Expected Output Schema:

Column Name, Data Type, Description
user_id, String, Unique identifier for the user
date, Date, Date of enquiry or transaction
count_enqs, Integer, Number of enquiries by the user on the date
count_txns, Integer, Number of transactions by the user on the date

Task 2: Enquiry Conversion Mapping

- Users express interest in a product by filling out an enquiry form.
- An enquiry is considered converted if the user completes a transaction within 30 days of submitting the enquiry.
- For each transaction, only the first enquiry made within the preceding 30 days is counted as converted.
- Each transaction can be linked to atmost one enquiry.
- However, a single enquiry may be linked to multiple transactions.

Expected Output Schema:

Column Name, Data Type, Description
enquiry_id, String, Unique identifier for the enquiry
date, Date, Date of the enquiry
user_id, String, Unique identifier for the user
txn_ids, Array, Array of transaction IDs linked to the enquiry; empty array if not converted

Notes:
txn_ids should be an array of transaction IDs corresponding to the enquiry.
If the enquiry is not converted, txn_ids should be an empty array.
